How to upgrade to Linux Mint 21
###############################

This page explains how to upgrade from Linux Mint 20.3 to Linux Mint 21.

First, refresh your cache and install the Upgrade Tool by typing the following commands in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

	apt update
	apt install mintupgrade

Then type the following command to launch the Upgrade Tool:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo mintupgrade

.. image:: images/upgrade21-mintupgrade.png

Follow the instructions on the screen.

When the tool is done and the upgrade is successful uninstall it and reboot your computer.

.. code-block:: bash

	apt remove mintupgrade
	sudo reboot

This is a major upgrade. It can take several hours.

You will be asked to be up to date and to prepare system snapshots. Do not rush, do not take shortcuts.

Donâ€™t hesitate to seek help if you have questions or if you face problems with the upgrade.

Troubleshooting
===============

Installing mintupgrade
----------------------

If you can't find `mintupgrade` in the repositories, switch to the default Linux Mint mirror and refresh the APT cache.

Repairing boot
--------------

If the computer no longer boots, boot from the live Linux Mint 21 ISO.

From the live session, launch `Boot Repair` and use it to fix the boot sequence.

If this doesn't work, boot from the live Linux Mint ISO again, and launch `Timeshift`.

Timeshift is able to scan your drives from the live session and restore your snapshot from there.

Notes
=====

The upgrade overwrites files in `/etc/` with default configuration files. You can restore files indivually by the Timeshift snapshot you made prior to upgrading.

To restore your lightDM settings, run the Login Window configuration tool (:command:`sudo lightdm-settings`).

Alternatives
============

If you cannot upgrade perform a `fresh installation <https://linuxmint-installation-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Generic instructions on `fresh upgrades <https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/2>`_ are also available.
